# TIL: Today I Learned

This is a collection of small write-ups of things I've learned in my role as a Cloud Engineer and
general enthusiast of devops.

I got the idea from many, many repos in GitHub doing the same thing. There are too many list.
Seriously, just search for 'TIL' and you'll see.


_1 TIL and counting..._

## How to add articles

Steps to follow:

1. Create directories for specific topics. For example if you learned something new in JavaScript,
   create a directory for the same.

2. Inside those directories create a [`Markdown`](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
	 file with your title for example `Variables-in-JavaScript.md`,
	 `Create_React_App.md` etc. Make sure that the markdown file has a title.
	 Spaces in titles are _not_ recommended since different services render
	 markdown differently.

3. Every Markdown TIL file should start with a `#` i.e h1 heading.

4. Once satisfied push your changes. The pipeline will update the `README` file automagically.


## About

This is the bit where I suppose I should talk about myself. May be I'll get round to updating this
at some point.
