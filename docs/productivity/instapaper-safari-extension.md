# Get the Instapaper Safari Extension working

## Problem

After installing the Instapaper Safari Extension, it doesn't work.
Clicking the button in the toolbar brings up a prompt to "login to the Mac app".
But logging in to the Instapaper Mac app doesn't fix the problem.

## Solution

The error message sounds like it wants you to open the Instapaper app for Mac and login there.
What it really means is login to the "Instapaper Save" Safari extension app, not the actual "Instapaper" app.
This app can be found in the Applications folder alongside the Instapaper app.
